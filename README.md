#Reposit

An app to help developers keep their side projects alive. 

Download it on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reposit-github-reminders/id955870688).

##Features
Reposit is a mobile app designed to help developers keep track of their side projects by tracking their most recent commits and sending notifications if they haven't pushed any commits recently enough. It's not easy to manage things outside of work or school--maybe your smartphone can help.


##Coming Soon

- iOS < 8 support
